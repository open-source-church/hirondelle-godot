## Getting started
1. To get started with GodotDiscordWebHooks install this plugin either from downloading / cloning the GitHub repository.
3. Get a [webhook url](https://github.com/TheLsbt/GodotDiscordWebHooks#get-a-webhook-url) if you haven't already.
4. Next you can [create your first message](https://github.com/TheLsbt/GodotDiscordWebHooks#my-first-message)


## My first message
1. After installing the files for GodotDiscordWebHooks, create a scene and attach a node to the root.
2. Open the script and create a _ready() function.
```gdscript
# In res://Node.gd
func  _ready() -> void:
   pass
```
3. Create a webhook object to send content and change the webhooks username. Remember to replace `WEBHOOK_URL` with your webhook's url. Get a [webhook url](https://github.com/TheLsbt/GodotDiscordWebHooks/wiki/Home/_edit#get-a-webhook-url) if you haven't already.
```gdscript
# In res://Node.gd
func _read() -> void:
	var webhook := DiscordWebHook.new(WEBHOOK_URL)
	webhook.message("Hello from godot!")
	webhook.username("A robot")
	# DiscordWebHook allows chaining so the above code can also be written as:
	# webhook.message("Hello from godot!").username("A robot")

```
4. Finally, we post the message, for this introduction we won't be doing anything with the response so we won't cast it
```gdscript
# In res://Node.gd
func _read() -> void:
	var webhook := DiscordWebHook.new(WEBHOOK_URL)
	webhook.message("Hello from godot!")
	webhook.username("A robot")

	# Post the message
	await webhook.post()
```
